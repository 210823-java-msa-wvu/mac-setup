## Install Using A Package Manager

A *package manager* is a command line tool that allows you to install and manage software. You can use a package manager to install all of the software listed here.

The package manager that we'll be using for this guide is called Homebrew. It's a command-line installer for MacOS, which means that you'll have to be running a macOS in order to use. If you are using a Windows machine the guide [here](https://github.com/210614-JavaFS/Enviroment-Setup) should be much more useful for you. The examples provided here are utilizing macvscodeOS Catalina version 10.15.5.

## Step 1: Install Homebrew

## Step 2: Install Git

With Homebrew installed, you are now ready to install Git. Open a terminal window and enter <code>brew install git</code>

To verify that Git is installed on your system, type <code>git --version</code>

## Step 3: Install JDK 8

Run the following commands in your terminal:
```code
brew untap adoptopenjdk/openjdk
brew untap caskroom/versions
brew cleanup
```

Once <code>cleanup</code> is finished, type the following command into the terminal:

<code>brew cask install adoptopenjdk/openjdk/adoptopenjdk8</code>


### Configure your Environment Variables
#### A. Mac OSX 10.5 or later:
In Mac OSX 10.5 or later, Apple recommends to set the <code>$JAVA_HOME</code> variable to <code>/usr/libexec/java_home</code>, just export <code>$JAVA_HOME</code> in file <code>~/. bash_profile</code> or ~<code>/.profile</code>.

```code
$ vim .bash_profile

export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)

$ source .bash_profile

$ echo $JAVA_HOME
/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.8.0.jdk/Contents/Home
```

#### B. Older Mac OSX:
For older Mac OSX, the <code>/usr/libexec/java_home</code> doesnâ€™t exist, so, you should set <code>JAVA_HOME</code> to the fixed path:

```code
$ vim .bash_profile

export JAVA_HOME=/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.8.0.jdk/Contents/Home

$ source .bash_profile

$ echo $JAVA_HOME
/System/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/1.8.0.jdk/Contents/Home
```


## Step 4:  Install IntelliJ IDEA

1. Navigate to the [JetBrains Installation Guide](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/installation-guide.html) page and install IntelliJ using the Toolbox App. The latest stable release is fine for our purposes (2021.2) The community edition is free, you do not need Ultimate! Follow the installation wizard's steps.

## Step 5: Install Maven

To install **Maven** with Homebrew, open your terminal window and run: <code>brew install maven</code> 

Once the download is complete, verify the installation by running: <code>mvn -v</code>

## Step 6: Install DBeaver

Navigate to https://dbeaver.io/download/ and download the appropriate version of DBeaver.

If your installation was successful, you should now be able to search for "dbeaver" in your spotlight with <code>cmd + space</code>.

## Step 7: Install Apache Tomcat 9
Follow these [instructions](https://medium.com/@jeongwhanchoi/how-to-install-apache-tomcat-on-mac-os-x-605b1cb55252). Make sure to install the latest version of Tomcat 9. 

## Step 8: Install Postman

The following is the single command required to install Postman on macOS using Homebrew:

<code>brew cask install postman</code>

## Step 9: Install Visual Studio Code

The following is the single command required to install Visual Studio Code on macOS using Homebrew:

<code>brew cask install visual-studio-code</code>

If you encounter problems and unable to install any of these applications with homebrew, refer to the manual download section of the [Environment Setup Guide](https://github.com/210614-JavaFS/Enviroment-Setup) to install it manually instead.
